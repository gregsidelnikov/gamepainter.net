<p>Hi, this is Greg.</p>

<p>You subscribed to my jQuery programming tutorials a while back.</p>

<p>Can you please add greg@learnjquery.org to the address book in your inbox?</p>

<p>I just wanted to make sure my emails will come through.</p>

<p>I'm writing you from my personal email at my indie game dev company I started few months go, because I have recently upgraded my newsletter software and just wanted to make sure my emails from the newsletter are still coming through.</p>

<p>It's been a while, and so I will totally understand if you're no longer interested in jQuery or JavaScript tutorials, in that case there is nothing you have to do.</p>

<p>Anyways, thanks for having been a subscriber. Much appreciated :)</p>

<p>Greg</p>
